Data from Sarah Wilterson from Hutter et al., 2018.

Average aim angle and implicit angle for the second trial of every rotation
mini block in each of four consistency groups.

-aim_angle: nSubs x nRotations, average explicit re-aiming angle at each 
 rotation level. Re-aiming angle is determined by angle between target
 and subjects intended aim.
-implici_angle: nSubs x nRotations, average explicit implicit adaptation
 angle at each rotation level. Implicit angle is determined by subtracting
 aim_angle from hand_angle (not included here).
-exp_params: nsubs per group = 20; rotation angles in the same order as 
 average data = -16, -8, -4, -2, 0, +2, +4, +8, 16; mini block size is
 level of consistency = 1, 2, 3, or 7.
